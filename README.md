Hands-on Reinforcement Learning Workshop using Python  

The Workshop is organized by Young Professionals Affinity Group in IEEE Montreal Section. The Workshop is lasted 5 hours and we have learned the underlying structure of Reinforcement Learning.  
The workshop had two sections: 
  * The Presentation Section  
  * The Code Section. 
In the presentation section, we have learned the common terminologies of Reinforcement Learning such as the agent, environment, action, state, action and observation space.  
In the code section, we have used the prebuilt environment "CartPole-v1" developed by OpenAI Gym and using the gym module, we have written our Agent. I would like to thank PhD student Sadia Khaf and M. Sc. student Faye Satari for conducting the Workshop.
